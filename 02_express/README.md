# Express.js Backend Project

This project is a basic implementation of a backend using Express.js. It covers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and advanced logging using Winston and Morgan. The logging information is stored in an `app.log` file.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:**
  - `GET` method: Fetch data from the server.
  - `POST` method: Add new data to the server.
  - `PUT` method: Update existing data on the server.
  - `DELETE` method: Remove data from the server.

- **Advanced Logging:**
  - Integrated `Winston` and `Morgan` for logging.
  - Logs requests and other events into `app.log`.
  - Different log levels are available to capture detailed information (info, error, warn, debug, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment to execute JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js used to handle routing and HTTP methods.
- **Winston**: Logging library for detailed logging of application behavior.
- **Morgan**: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.
